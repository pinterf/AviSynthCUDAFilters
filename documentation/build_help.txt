Actions logged during the process of porting Nekopanda's CUDA filters
to work under current Avisynth+, CUDA 11.2 and VS2019 environment (20210209)

Note:
CUDA Filters are using PNeoEnv interface which is not finalized at present state of Avisynth+.
When PNeoEnv in avisynth.h is changed, these filters should be rebuilt with the actual avisynth.h headers.
(Same as was the case for IScriptEnvironment2)

Work in progress; changes after Avisynth+ v3.7 release are required in order to compile (plus of course the
CUDA option - normal Avisynth+ does not comes with CUDA-aware internals)
As of 20210209: Avisynth+ source (https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus), plus Avisynth.h from here
together are enough to compile Avisynth with ENABLE_CUDA define, CMakeList.txt supports the option as well.

Visual Studio 2019 and CUDA SDK 11.2 is required. 

Each SDK version requires a minimum NVidia driver version. Older video cards which have reached their EndOfLife
and are not receiving new drivers, are left unsupported; our programs made with SDK 11.2 won't run on them.

For compatible driver versions see https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html

Process of transition (kept for reference)

0.) Download and install NVidia CUDA SDK 11.2.
    As of 2021 March the latest version is 11.2 Update 1
    https://developer.nvidia.com/Cuda-downloads
    You can choose the Network Install, Special.
    For CUDA development point of view you can ignore Physics in Other Components.
    When your system is a non-NVidia one then uncheck Driver Components as well.
    (Actual driver version is 461.09)
    Under "CUDA" Development and VS Integration are the key components.
    This will integrate with the existing Visual Studio 2019 (BuildCustomization files)
    Build process can be done even on a non-NVidia system.
1.) Grab the "core": AvisynthCUDAFilters.
    Original repo AvisynthCUDAFilters forked from Nekopanda to pinterf in order to make the
    necessary modifications to work with current Avisynth+ 3.7.
    https://github.com/nekopanda/AviSynthCUDAFilters
    https://github.com/pinterf/AviSynthCUDAFilters
    Info: AvisynthCUDAFilters has some core component, but includes two external
    classic Avisynth plugins: NNEDI3 ans masktools; both as git submodule.
2.) Let's fork Nekopanda's masktools and NNEDI3 cuda branch to pinterf repo.
    Neo created a new 'cuda' branch for both, so it was enough to import only 'cuda'.
2.1) The first submodule: masktools
    masktools2 was/is maintained at pinterf's repo.
    Nekopanda developed a cuda branch: implementing lut and lutxy named with 'k' prefix.
    The other filters in it were mainly untouched, only the framework was established.
2.2.1) 
    So we leave the existing masktools as is, and fetch back the new 'cuda' branch 
    of Nekopanda's fork to pinterf's existing repo.
    From masktools2 repo root folder: 
      git fetch git://github.com/nekopanda/masktools.git cuda:cuda
    Now we have duplicated Nekopanda's cuda branch into to our existing repo.
2.2.2) 
    Next we update the development environment and source of cuda branch.
    (Old one was for CUDA SDK 8.0 and VS2015)
    - Opened the solution with Visual Studio 2019
    - CUDA SDK 11.2
    - In order to have cuda masktools to build standalone (not as AvisynthCUDAFilters subproject),
      we have to copy AvisynthCUDAFilters/common content to masktools2 folder.
    - Then updated Avisynth+ headers
    - Apply change to 'common' source files where PNeoEnv syntax is different.
      (naming is mostly kept, but frame property handling is totally different)
    - folder reorganizations
2.2) nnedi3 things.
     Spoiler: the cuda branch of this project cannot be built separately yet (like masktools); only
     as a submodule of AvisynthCUDAFilters.
2.2.1 Since I didn't have NNEDI3, I have forked the master repo from jpsdr to pinterf. 
      https://github.com/jpsdr/NNEDI3.git
2.2.2 Once forked, cloned it locally from https://github.com/pinterf/NNEDI3.git
2.2.3 Now we'll add a new branch 'cuda' which we are importing from Nekopanda.
      Fetching the new 'cuda' branch from Nekopanda's nnedi3 fork:

  git fetch git://github.com/nekopanda/NNEDI3.git cuda:cuda

  command result:  
    remote: Enumerating objects: 64, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (64/64), done.
    remote: Total 94 (delta 64), reused 64 (delta 64), pack-reused 30
    Unpacking objects: 100% (94/94), 20.58 KiB | 28.00 KiB/s, done.
    From git://github.com/nekopanda/NNEDI3
    * [new branch]      cuda       -> cuda

2.2.4 Change to 'cuda' branch, update project 
    (from Cuda SDK 8.0+VS2015)
    - Visual Studio 2019
    - CUDA SDK 11.2

3.) Next we have to update AvisynthCUDAFilters project.

    AvisynthCUDAFilters has three git submodules that are still pointed to the original url (Nekopanda repo)
    These are: masktools, NNEDI3 and googletest
    The first two are to be changed.
    
3.1) In AvisynthCUDAFilters git config we are going to redirect masktools submodule 
     to pinterf's masktools

3.1.1 From repo's root (Developer Command Prompt) issue the following commands:

  git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.masktools.url https://github.com/pinterf/masktools.git
  git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.masktools.branch cuda
  git config --file=.gitmodules --list

  command result with the changes masktools url path
    submodule.googletest.path=googletest
    submodule.googletest.url=https://github.com/nekopanda/googletest.git
    submodule.nnedi3.path=nnedi3
    submodule.nnedi3.url=https://github.com/nekopanda/NNEDI3.git
    submodule.masktools.path=masktools
    submodule.masktools.url=https://github.com/pinterf/masktools.git
    submodule.masktools.branch=cuda

3.1.2 Finalize the config url changes to git.

  git submodule sync

  command result:
    Synchronizing submodule url for 'googletest'
    Synchronizing submodule url for 'masktools'
    Synchronizing submodule url for 'nnedi3'

  Check: the file .git/modules/masktools/config is changed as:

    [core]
      repositoryformatversion = 0
      filemode = false
      bare = false
      logallrefupdates = true
      symlinks = false
      ignorecase = true
      worktree = ../../../masktools
    [remote "origin"]
      url = https://github.com/pinterf/masktools.git
      fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    [branch "cuda"]
      remote = origin
      merge = refs/heads/cuda

3.1.3 Update the submodule's source from our new own repo
  This will init all submodules of the root repo.
  
  git submodule update --init --recursive --remote

command result:
  remote: Enumerating objects: 585, done.
  remote: Counting objects: 100% (585/585), done.
  remote: Compressing objects: 100% (160/160), done.

3.2) Redirect NNEDI3
    In AvisynthCUDAFilters git config we are going to redirect NNEDI3 submodule 
    to pinterf's NNEDI3

3.2.1) From AvisynthCUDAFilters repo's root (Developer Command Prompt) issue commands

  git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.nnedi3.url https://github.com/pinterf/NNEDI3.git
  git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.nnedi3.branch cuda
  git config --file=.gitmodules --list

3.2.2 Finalize the config url changes to git.

  git submodule sync

  command result:
    Synchronizing submodule url for 'googletest'
    Synchronizing submodule url for 'masktools'
    Synchronizing submodule url for 'nnedi3'

  Check it: the file .git/modules/nnedi3/config is changed as:

  [core]
    repositoryformatversion = 0
    filemode = false
    bare = false
    logallrefupdates = true

    merge = refs/heads/cuda 

3.1.3 Update the submodule's source from our new own repo
  This will init all submodules of the root repo.

  git submodule update --init --recursive --remote

4.) copy avisynth.lib to lib\x64\ and lib\x86\
    (Obtained from the Output folder when building Avisynth+)
    (? I don't know why this one is needed)

5.) (to-do)
    - update google tests (and figure out how they were used)
    - masktools: make a smarter way of reusing 'common' folder in submodules,
      and still allowing them to build separately.
      cuda and main fork differs inconveniently, even the placement of sln file
    - nnedi3 cannot be built separately, only as an AvisynthCUDAFilters submodule
    - Translate Japanese to English + doc to English
    - check GRunT, it's in the KFM package; it has a smaller subset of functions
    - nnedi3 to work at 10+ bits
    - Understand things, Nekopanda has created

6.) Quickies for myself:
- When a submodule is changed, in AvisynthCUDAFilters command prompt
    git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
  (AvisynthCUDAFilters builds NNEDI3 and Kmasktools, since they are submodules there)
- What to do them PNeoEnv interface in avisynth.h is changed?
  Whenever there is change in PNeoEnv (in avisynth.h), every filter using PNeoEnv 
  should be rebuild as well with the new avisynth.h header.
  
  So each Avisynth version with different PNeoNev needs a new set of matching plugins.

  Rebuild avisynth (with CUDA option), we'll need
    Copy AviSynthPlus\Output\c_api\avisynth.lib to lib\x64\ and lib\x86\
    Avisynth+\Output\Avisynth.dll
  Update masktools 'cuda' branch (separate project!) in masktools/include/avisynth.h, push to git
  Refresh AvisynthCUDAFilters submodules: git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
    (that will bring back masktools changes)
  Update AvisynthCUDAFilters/include/avisynth.h
- Build:
  build solution, for x64: check AviSynthCUDAFilters\x64\Release\
    for KFM package:
      KFM.dll
      AvsCUDA.dll
      GRunT.dll
      KFMDeint.avsi
    for KTGMC package:
      KTGMC.dll
      KNNEDI3.dll (knnedi3, knnedi3_rpow2, names are different)
      KTGMC.avsi
      KSMDegrain.avsi
    Other
      KMaskTools.dll (kmt_lut and kmt_lutxy, can safely live besides masktools2.dll)
    Remarks:
      KUtil.dll (generic plugin; contains one function: IsProcess(string "processname") e.g. one can check is script is run from avspmod) 
      GRunT.dll (much less functions than original one, using Global variable frame, and relies on actual PNeoEnv)
      KDebugTool.dll - for debug: Time check for profiling and Image comparer)
